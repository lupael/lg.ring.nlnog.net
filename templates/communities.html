<h2>
   Known BGP Communities
</h2>
<p>
This Looking Glass uses a collection of known BGP communities to provide additional information on routes received. New community descriptions and updates can be added sending a pull request on the <a href="https://github.com/NLNOG/lg.ring.nlnog.net/">Github repostory</a>, which also provides information on the file format. For any questions, feel free to contact the <a href=""mailto:ring-admins@nlnog.net">ring-admins@nlnog.net</a>. Please note that you don't need to be
the owner of the ASN to provide information!
</p>
<p>
Community descriptions are available for the following ASNs:
</p>
<table class="table table-striped table-bordered table-condensed table-communities">
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <td>Community</td>
            <td>Type</td>
            <td>Description</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        {% for asn, desc in communities %}
        <tr class="{{ loop.cycle('odd', 'even') }}">
            <td class="text-end"><a href="/communitylist/{{asn}}">{{asn}}</a></td>
